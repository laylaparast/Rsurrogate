%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
Calculates robust residual treatment effect accounting for multiple surrogate markers at a specified time and primary outcome information up to that specified time
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
This function calculates the robust estimate of the residual treatment effect accounting for multiple surrogate markers measured at \eqn{t_0} and primary outcome information up to \eqn{t_0} i.e. the hypothetical treatment effect if both the surrogate marker distributions at \eqn{t_0} and survival up to \eqn{t_0} in the treatment group look like the surrogate marker distributions and survival up to \eqn{t_0} in the control group. Ideally this function is only used as a helper function and is not directly called.

delta.multiple.surv(xone, xzero, deltaone, deltazero, sone, szero, type =1, t,

\arguments{
  \item{xone}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{xone} here~~
numeric vector, the observed event times in the treatment group, X = min(T,C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time.
}
  \item{xzero}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{xzero} here~~
numeric vector, the observed event times in the control group, X = min(T,C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time.
}
  \item{deltaone}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{deltaone} here~~
numeric vector, the event indicators for the treatment group, D = I(T<C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time.

}
  \item{deltazero}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{deltazero} here~~
numeric vector, the event indicators for the control group, D = I(T<C) where T is the time of the primary outcome and C is the censoring time.
}
 \item{sone}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{sone} here~~
matrix of numeric values; surrogate marker measurements at \eqn{t_0} for treated observations. If \eqn{X_{1i}<t_0}, then the surrogate marker measurements should be NA. 

}
  \item{szero}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{szero} here~~
matrix of numeric values; surrogate marker measurements at \eqn{t_0} for control observations. If \eqn{X_{0i}<t_0}, then the surrogate marker measurements should be NA.
}
  \item{type}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{t} here~~
type of estimate; options are 1 = two-stage robust estimator, 2 = weighted two-stage robust estimator, 3 = double-robust estimator, 4 = two-stage model-based estimator, 5 = weighted estimator, 6 = double-robust model-bsed estimator; default is 1.
}
  \item{t}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{t} here~~
the time of interest.
}
  \item{weight.perturb}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{weight.perturb} here~~
weights used for perturbation resampling.
}
  \item{landmark}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{landmark} here~~
the landmark time \eqn{t_0} or time of surrogate marker measurement.
}
  \item{extrapolate}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{extrapolate} here~~
TRUE or FALSE; indicates whether the user wants to use extrapolation.
}
  \item{transform}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{transform} here~~
TRUE or FALSE; indicates whether the user wants to use a transformation for the surrogate marker psuedo-score. 
}
  \item{approx}{
TRUE or FALSE indicating whether an approximation should be used when calculating the probability of censoring; most relevant in settings where the survival time of interest for the primary outcome is greater than the last observed event but before the last censored case, default is TRUE.

\note{If the treatment effect is not significant, the user will receive the following message: "Warning: it looks like the treatment effect is not significant; may be difficult to interpret the residual treatment effect in this setting". If the treatment effect is negative, the user will receive the following message: "Warning: it looks like you need to switch the treatment groups" as this package assumes throughout that larger values of the event time are better.}
